Democracy and Life: A Dataset
================

# Raw Data

  - I downloaded the raw life expectancy dataset
    `raw-data/API_SP.DYN.LE00.IN_DS2_en_csv_v2_315861.csv` from [the
    World
    Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/sp.dyn.le00.in?most_recent_year_desc=false&view=map)
    (variable indicator code: SP.DYN.LE00.IN) on 2019-10-20.
      - “Life expectancy at birth, total (years)”
      - “Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a
        newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at
        the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its
        life.”
  - I download the Polity IV dataset `raw-data/p4v2018.xls` from the
    [Center for Systematic
    Peace](http://www.systemicpeace.org/inscrdata.html) on 2019-20-20.
